#### Achievements

- Initiated and created an automated billing system for the AWS platform that allowed to see the cost spent on every resource by name as well as the project it is dedicated to for smoother operations.
- Created a pipeline for real-time data consumption and display in conjunction with the AWS team, for the company to use batch data to model our AI but also use real-time data providing alarms, anomalies, and other real-time changes.
- Initiated a process where cloud architects are directed to build secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient infrastructure for a variety of applications in conjunction with the AWS team which led to getting $5000 in AWS credits.
- Implemented AWS Single Sign-On (AWS SSO) where you create or connect, your workforce identities in AWS once and manage access centrally across your AWS organization, managing access just to AWS accounts or cloud applications.
- Reduced the hassle of passwords and account numbers and helped when we moved to a multi-account strategy making it secure as it is integrated by 2-way verification which we set up on our Gmail.
- Implemented IAM that deals with the access control to assets inside AWS where AWS IAM provides permanent access to an AWS account to provide access to code repositories on GitHub as well as Users before the introduction of SSO.
- Studied virtual private networks that address the challenge of resources being able to remain secure and inside company space which can access the internet and communicate with the internet as well as each other.
- Created a workspace set up for individuals working from home where all the work done by an employee is done inside the workspace under company control.
- Assisted in easy monitoring of the employees without the restriction of physical location, access to their work status as well as the security of data that stays in the company network and improved work efficiency by 20%.
